# OverBit-AntiCheat
 OverBit AntiCheat |  Client-side Protection for Minecraft

OverBit is a client-server based anti-cheat system that requires the player to run a verified client before fully joining the server.
This allows you to:
-Block cheat usage before verification is complete.
-Ban players based on their HWID.

ðŸ”§ How does it work?
-The player joins the server.
-The server sends a message asking the player to launch the OverBit Client.
-If the player does not complete the verification â€” they are automatically kicked
